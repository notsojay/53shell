# 53shell

* 53shell is a simple yet powerful UNIX-style shell program written in C. It offers fundamental shell functionalities such as command execution, input/output redirection, and pipes. This makes it an excellent tool for learning and understanding the concepts of the UNIX operating system, especially processes, pipes, and I/O redirection.

## Features

* Command Execution - The commands entered are parsed and executed. These could be built-in commands like cd, exit, etc., or system commands like ls, cat, etc.
* Input/Output Redirection - Supports redirection of command output to a file or reading input from a file using > and < symbols respectively.
* Pipes - Supports the use of | symbol to create a pipeline of commands, where the output of one command serves as the input to the next.
